## BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS 

- The segment for the client to prioritize are customers that are from he USA, have a B27 education level and are subscribers by the second message.
- The USA generates above 50% high-value customers, i.e. "leads" among the client's global base compared to other country-wise segments.
- Based on defined set of actions, sending demo invites to the customers has the potential to generate the highest sales followed by nudging the platform signup.
- A possible reason could be that high-valued leads, or even the potentials gravitate strongly towards the product when have a better visual idea via live demos.
- Live demos also might help signficantly in bridging the communication gap with customers - something that signficantly reduce attrition and increase retention.
- The platform signup for new users - while not a very robust action from the security standpoint, immediately hooks the users to the product.
- So, a tradeoff strategy could be developed where users can has a trail period and then prompted towards paid subscription.
